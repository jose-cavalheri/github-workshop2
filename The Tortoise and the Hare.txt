Once upon a time, there was a tortoise and a hare who were always bragging about who was faster. One day, they decided to have a race to settle the matter once and for all. The hare was so confident that he would win that he took a nap under a tree while the tortoise slowly made his way to the finish line. When the hare woke up, he was shocked to see that the tortoise had already crossed the finish line and won the race.

Moral of the story:

Slow and steady wins the race. It is better to be slow and careful than to be fast and careless.
